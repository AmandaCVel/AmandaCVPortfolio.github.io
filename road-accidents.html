	</span>Underneath the Fatal Casualties, you'll find the Casualties by Vehicle Type. 
	They are in order from highest to lowest casualties; with cars or private vehicles being the most, different types of motorcycles second,

	To the right you can see the month-to-month casualties based on the year.  </p>

	The “Data Analysis Sheet” shows all the data that has been processed and cleaned then put into PivotTables.

	Client wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements:
		<ul>

		<li>Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Year 2022 and Year 2021</li>
		<li>Maximum casualties by Road Type</li>
		<li>Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface</li>
		<li>Relation between Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night</li>
